"""Evaluator for SHERLOC fault-localization predictions.

This module scores the diagnostic localizations produced by the SHERLOC generation task
against the gold locations of a SWE-Bench instance. Gold locations are recovered from the
reference patch with :meth:`PatchProcessor.extract_locations_from_patch`, which returns one
``{file_path, start_line, end_line, raw}`` entry per line touched in the *original* file.
Predicted locations use the same schema and are read from the ``locations`` field written by
the generation step.

Two families of scores are computed per instance:

* **File level** (:func:`evaluate_file_level_accuracy`) - set comparison between the gold and
  predicted *file* sets. ``recall`` here is the quantity the paper reports: on SWE-Bench
  Verified its mean over instances is Recall@1, and on SWE-Bench Lite (whose gold patches
  touch exactly one file) its mean is Accuracy@1.
* **Chunk level** (:func:`evaluate_chunk_containment_metrics`) - line-range comparison inside
  a matched file, crediting predictions that fully enclose a gold hunk.

The evaluator is destructive with respect to its inputs: each input ``.jsonl`` file is
rewritten in place with an ``eval_status`` field added to every entry, plus a
``processing_stats`` field on the first entry. :class:`SherlocMetrics`
(``recipes.sherloc.metrics.sherloc``) consumes exactly those fields.
