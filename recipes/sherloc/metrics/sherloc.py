"""Aggregation of SHERLOC fault-localization scores into reportable metrics.

This module turns the per-instance ``eval_status`` blocks written by the SHERLOC evaluator
(``recipes.sherloc.evaluation.sherloc``) into the aggregate numbers reported for a run.
It is selected through ``METRICS_TYPE = "sherloc"`` in the benchmark definition.

Mapping to the paper's tables
-----------------------------
Every per-generation score lives in ``eval_status[0]``, under ``file_level`` (file-set
comparison) and ``chunk_containment`` (line-range comparison). This class averages each score
unweighted over the *scored generations*: those whose gold patch yields at least one location.
Generations with no gold locations are counted separately under ``samples_no_gt`` and are left
out of every average, while instances the pipeline failed or skipped keep their all-zero score
block and so do count against the averages. With a single generation per instance, which is
the setting the paper reports, one scored generation is one benchmark instance. The reported
keys are then scaled to percentages:

* ``file_recall`` - mean over scored instances of
  ``|gold_files ∩ predicted_files| / |gold_files|``.
  This is the paper's **Recall@1** on SWE-Bench Verified. On SWE-Bench Lite, whose gold patches
  touch exactly one file, the per-instance value is 0 or 1 and the mean is the paper's
  **Accuracy@1**: the percentage of instances in which the single gold file was predicted.
* ``file_precision`` - mean of ``|gold_files ∩ predicted_files| / |predicted_files|``.
* ``file_f1`` - mean of the per-instance F1 of the two above. Note this is a mean of
  per-instance F1 values, not the F1 of the mean precision and recall.
* ``file_accuracy`` - mean per-instance Jaccard index of the two file sets. Despite the name
  this is *not* the paper's Accuracy@1; use ``file_recall`` for that.
* ``file_exact_match`` - fraction of instances whose predicted file set equals the gold set
  exactly.
* ``chunk_coverage_recall`` - mean fraction of gold hunks fully enclosed by some predicted
  line range in the same file.
* ``chunk_precision`` - mean fraction of predicted ranges that enclose at least one gold hunk.
* ``chunk_avg_tightness`` - mean of the per-instance tightness scores. Within each instance,
  tightness is the mean ratio of gold-hunk length to the tightest enclosing prediction over
  enclosed hunks; an instance with no enclosed hunk contributes 0. 100% means predictions
  matched the gold ranges exactly; lower values mean misses or padded ranges.

The ``@1`` in the paper's metric names refers to a single generation per instance, i.e. the
``pass@1`` aggregation mode.
