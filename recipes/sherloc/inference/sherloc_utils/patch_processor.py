"""Reference edit locations extracted from gold patches.

SHERLOC predictions are scored against the locations that the reference fix of
an issue touches. That fix ships as a unified diff, so this module maps a diff
to the files and line ranges it modifies. Ranges are reported in the coordinate
system of the pre-patch file, which is the version of the repository the agent
inspects, so predicted and reference locations are directly comparable.
